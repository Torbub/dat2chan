<h3> How to use dat2chan </h3>
I recently implemented a simple Lexer (all credz go to Emil) on dat2chan. The Lexer allows you to control the formatting of your posts using a lisp-like syntax. The following commands are currently avalible:
<ol>
    <li>(code)if(OP===faggot){return true;}(code) - Use this if you want to post code. Remember to close with a second (code) tag.</li>
    <li>(bold This text will be bold) - Used to make text bold.</li>
    <li>(italic This text will be italic) - Used to make text italic</li>
    <li>(quote 123) - Used to quote other posts (123 represents the id of the post you wish to quote)</li>
    <li>(cite "a citation/quote goes here" legitsource.com) - Makes a citation. Put the actual quote/citation inside quotes ("like this"), and the source of the quote afterwards.</li>
    <li>(bold (italic tags can be combined)) - tags can be combined. Just be sure to close them properly!</li>
</ol>
